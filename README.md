# Certification Resources

**“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax” - Abraham Lincoln**

This repo is my collection of certification resources that I have curated during my journey to achieving various professional certifications. These materials reflect my focus towards continuous learning and personal growth in my field. By sharing these study resources, I hope to support others on their certification journey, hoping to make the process more efficient. 

My study strategy has always involved researching what resources to best utilize to help prepare me for my studies. Reading an entire textbook just to prepare for specific exam objectives is cumbersome, so using multiple resources, I created my own study notes/materials for each exam that I share with you. Once I’ve spent roughly 2 weeks creating notes, I set out an exam date in the future. It’s important to ensure that you book your exam dates in advance as to have a date to work towards and try your best to not push it back, this will put stress on you too study.

I make sure to gather as many practice exam questions available to ensure that I cover a variety of different question types, I find doing practice questions from different providers not only gives me more practice, but each tend to ask questions differently. This helps to prepare you for how *read* questions carefully more than just the technical aspect of studying. 

My daily studying schedule is to read 50+ pages of my notes, do 200-400 practice questions and spend 30-60 minutes solely dedicated to exploring subjects that I’ve marked challenging, new or am testing poorly on in practice questions. Practicing this strategy daily ensure that the material is spaced out in a digestible manner and keeping the knowledge fresh in my memory leading up to exam date.
